# Countdown Timer with Sound

This project provides a countdown timer that plays a sound every second, alternating between two sound files, until it reaches a specified date and time.

The timer is based on the date for Baldur's Gate on PC: "2023-08-03 10:00:00" Central Standard Time (CST), and it uses the system's time to calculate the remaining time. The timer and the remaining time are displayed in a digital clock style in the middle of the screen.

## Features
